# Patient---Record--Database

The patient record is the principal repository for information concerning a patient's health care. It affects, in some way, virtually everyone associated with providing, receiving, or reimbursing health care services. Despite the many technological advances in health care over the past few decades, the typical patient record of today is remarkably similar to the patient record of 50 years ago. This failure of patient records to evolve is now creating additional stress within the already burdened health care system as the information needs of practitioners, patients, administrators, researchers, and policymakers often go unmet. The intricate machinery of our health care system can no longer grasp the threads of experience… Too often, payers, physicians, and health care executives do not share common insights into the life of the patient… The health care system has become an organism guided by misguided choices; it is unstable, confused, and desperately in need of a central nervous system that can help it cope with the complexities of modern medicine. Patient record improvement could make major contributions to improving the health care system of this nation. 

# LINKED LIST:

linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a link to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. The principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure. Linked lists allow insertion and removal of nodes at any point in the list, and allow doing so with a constant number of operations by keeping the link previous to the link being added or removed in memory during list traversal. The Linked list are dynamic, so the length of list can increase or decrease as necessary. Each node does not necessarily follow the previous one physically in the memory. 

# PROBLEM STATEMENT AND OBJECTIVE:

During hard times like pandemics and epidemics there is widespread of disease so the number of patients increase exponentially which is a lot more compared to the general number of patients., maintaining patient records and their medical history is one of the major issues faced by the medical authority so this problem needs to be tackled for better care and treatment of the patients

# ALGORITHM:

1. Initially the program will provide the user four options basically to add a data, access the data, view history, delete the data and to exit the program when the user is done.
2. If the user opts for the first option i.e. to add data the program asks the user to enter the data and adds it at the beginning of the list like in a stack.
3. If the user opts for the second option which is to access the previously added data the program then asks for the patient's name and displays the related data. if 
the list is empty the program will not ask for specifics and directly display that the list is empty.
4. If the user opts for the third option which is to delete any previously added data the program asks the patient’s name whose data is to be removed and then it pops it out the list and stores it in the other list for future references, if the list is empty the program will not ask for specifics and directly display that the list is empty.
5. If the user opts for fourth option which is to view patient’s history then the program asks for the patient’s name and searches it in the backup list where all the removed data is stored and displays the related data if it finds any.
6. Finally, if the user opts for fifth option then he/she exits the program.

# APPLICATION AND ADVANTAGES:

1. It will be helpful for the doctors to treat patient easily.
2. It improves efficiencies and lower health care costs
3. Better clinical decision making by integrating patient information from multiple sources.
4. Improves patient and provider interaction and communication.
5.Enabling safer, more reliable prescribing.
